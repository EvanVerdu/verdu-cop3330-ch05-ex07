 Quadratic equations are of the form
a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0

 To solve these, one uses the quadratic formula:

 x = - b +- sqrt(b^2-4ac) / 2a

 There is a problem, though: if b2â€“4ac is less than zero, then it will fail.
Write a program that can calculate x for a quadratic equation. Create a
function that prints out the roots of a quadratic equation, given a, b, c.
When the program detects an equation with no real roots, have it print
out a message. How do you know that your results are plausible? Can
you check that they are correct?
